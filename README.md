# Data pre-processing: Python vs R dplyr

This repository contains both a Python notebook and an R script for the same data cleaning and wrangling task to demonstrate the equivalent code structures in these two languages. Pre-processing task includes but not limited to:
 - Reading in .sav data files
 - Dealing with labelled data and value labels
 - Basic frequency tables
 - Filtering by group
 - Removing missing data
 - Creating new variables or recoding them into the same ones
 - Calculating group-centered/scaled variables
 - Removing outliers based on within-group quartiles
 - Replacing missing values with group means
 - Exporting data into csv
